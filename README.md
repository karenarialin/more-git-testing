Congratulations! If you're reading this, you weren't fooled by the boring repo name and have stumbled upon a scandalous masterpiece.

What started as a debate between coworkers became this script.

1. Colin wrote a Python script replacing every instance of the word "Karen" with "Pot", which was amusing because Karen is incredibly straightedge.

2. In retaliation, Karen renamed the script colin.py, which replaces every instance of "Colin" with a random variation of "Pot". It also now allows us to open a file by dragging it directly into the terminal. 

3. Karen added keyboard interrupt handling to satisfy a different coworker, who is actually a software engineer.
